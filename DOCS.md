## Feature Usage Guide

### Getting Started

#### 1. Obtaining Seeds
As an admin, use the Strain Creator GUI:
```
/straincreator
```
This opens a modern GUI where you can:
- Click the name tag to rename the strain (type name in chat, auto-returns to GUI)
- Click rarity icon to cycle through: Common → Uncommon → Rare → Legendary
- Click the star icon to select seed quality (★1-5)
- Use +/- buttons to adjust Potency, Yield, and Packaging Quality
- Shift-click for larger adjustments (+10 instead of +5)
- Drag an item onto the icon slot to set the strain's appearance
- Click the emerald block to save and receive 5 seeds

#### 2. Planting Seeds (Pot-Based - Recommended)

**New Pot-Based Growing System:**
1. Obtain a **Growing Pot** ★ (via admin commands or crafting)
2. Place the pot on any solid surface (right-click)
3. Hold seeds in your main hand
4. Right-click the pot to plant

**Legacy Farmland Growing:**
1. Create farmland using a hoe on dirt/grass
2. Hold seeds in your main hand
3. Right-click on the farmland

**Growth Tips:**
- Use higher ★ pots for faster growth and better quality
- Water your plants regularly with a bucket
- Apply fertilizer for nutrient boost
- Place grow lamps nearby for quality bonus
- Surround plants with walls for enclosed growing bonus

#### 3. Caring for Plants

**Watering:**
- Right-click on a plant with a water bucket
- Water level slowly decreases over time
- Keep water level above 70% for quality bonus

**Fertilizing:**
- Craft or obtain fertilizer (★1-5 quality)
- Right-click on a plant with fertilizer
- Higher ★ fertilizer gives better nutrient boost

**Lighting:**
- Place Grow Lamps (★1-5) near your plants
- Better lamps provide more light and quality bonus
- Special glow particles show lamp effect

#### 4. Harvesting

**Without Scissors:**
- Wait for plants to reach the mature stage (4th stage)
- Right-click or break the plant to harvest
- You'll receive buds based on the strain's yield and quality bonuses

**With Harvest Scissors (Recommended):**
- Obtain Harvest Scissors (★1-5 quality)
- Right-click on mature plant with scissors
- Benefits:
  - Yield bonus based on scissors quality
  - Chance to upgrade bud quality
  - Chance for rare bonus seeds
  - Better final bud ★ rating

#### 5. Packaging
Convert raw buds into sellable packages:
```
/package 1   - Creates 1g package (×1.0 multiplier)
/package 3   - Creates 3g package (×1.25 multiplier)
/package 5   - Creates 5g package (×1.5 multiplier)
/package 10  - Creates 10g package (×2.0 multiplier)
```

#### 6. Selling
1. Find or spawn a trader:
   - **Market Joe** - Regular prices (admin: `/spawnmarket`)
   - **BlackMarket Joe** - Better prices for rare strains (admin: `/spawnblackmarket`)
   - **Village Vendors** - Any unemployed villager, lower prices

2. Hold your packaged product and right-click the trader
3. If the deal succeeds, you receive money!
4. If the deal fails, you'll have a cooldown before trying again

## Star Quality System

The ★ Star Quality System (1-5 stars) applies to all growing equipment and affects the final bud quality.

### Star Ratings

| Rating | Display | Color | Quality Mult | Growth Speed |
|--------|---------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| ★☆☆☆☆ | 1 Star | Gray | ×1.0 | 0.8x |
| ★★☆☆☆ | 2 Star | Yellow | ×1.15 | 0.9x |
| ★★★☆☆ | 3 Star | Green | ×1.35 | 1.0x |
| ★★★★☆ | 4 Star | Blue | ×1.6 | 1.15x |
| ★★★★★ | 5 Star | Gold | ×2.0 | 1.35x |

### Items with Star Ratings

#### Growing Pot ★
- Base for pot-based growing
- Affects overall growth speed
- Higher ★ = faster growth, better base quality
- Place on any solid surface

#### Seeds ★
- Set during strain creation
- Affects final bud potential
- Better seeds = better maximum quality

#### Grow Lamp ★
- Provides light to plants
- Affects quality bonus
- Higher ★ = more light, better efficiency

#### Fertilizer ★
- Boosts nutrient levels
- Affects quality and growth
- Higher ★ = more nutrients, longer duration

#### Harvest Scissors ★
- Used for harvesting
- Affects yield and quality
- Higher ★ = bonus yield, quality upgrade chance, rare drops

### Final Bud Rating Calculation

The final bud ★ rating is calculated from a weighted combination:
- **Pot**: 20%
- **Seed**: 25%
- **Lamp**: 20%
- **Fertilizer**: 15%
- **Scissors**: 10%
- **Care Quality**: 10%

**Example:**
- 5★ Pot + 4★ Seed + 3★ Lamp + 4★ Fertilizer + 5★ Scissors + 90% care
- = (5×0.2) + (4×0.25) + (3×0.2) + (4×0.15) + (5×0.1) + (4.5×0.1)
- = 1.0 + 1.0 + 0.6 + 0.6 + 0.5 + 0.45 = 4.15 → **4★ Bud**

## Pot-Based Growing

### Overview
The new pot-based growing system replaces farmland planting with a more interactive and rewarding experience.

### Growing Pot Types
Growing pots are placed on any solid surface and act as containers for your plants.

| Star | Growth Speed | Quality Bonus |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| ★☆☆☆☆ | -20% slower | +0% |
| ★★☆☆☆ | -10% slower | +15% |
| ★★★☆☆ | Normal | +35% |
| ★★★★☆ | +15% faster | +60% |
| ★★★★★ | +35% faster | +100% |

### Care System

**Water Level (0-100%)**
- Starts at 70% in new pots
- Decreases slowly over time
- Water with bucket to refill to 100%
- Below 30%: Quality penalty
- Above 70%: Quality bonus

**Nutrient Level (0-100%)**
- Starts at 50% in new pots
- Decreases slowly over time
- Apply fertilizer to boost
- Affects growth speed and quality

### Plant Status Display
Right-click a growing plant to see status:
```
━━━━ OG Kush ━━━━
Stage: Sprout (2/4)
Pot: ★★★☆☆
Seed: ★★★★☆
Water: 85%
Nutrients: 60%
Lamp: ★★★★★
Quality: ★★★☆☆ Good
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Seeds can only be planted on farmland or in Growing Pots!"
- Use a Growing Pot (right-click on solid surface with pot)
- Or use a hoe on dirt/grass to create farmland (legacy mode)

#### Plants Not Growing Fast Enough
- Use higher ★ rated pots
- Keep water level above 70%
- Apply fertilizer for nutrient boost
- Add a grow lamp nearby

#### Harvest Scissors Not Working
- Ensure they are BudLords Harvest Scissors (with ★ rating in lore)
- Regular shears won't provide bonuses

#### Low Bud Quality
- Use better ★ rated equipment (pot, seed, lamp, fertilizer, scissors)
- Maintain high water and nutrient levels
- Higher star ratings across all components = higher final rating

### Data Files

All data is stored in `plugins/BudLords/`:
- `config.yml` - Main configuration
- `strains.yml` - Strain definitions
- `players.yml` - Player balances and stats

### Getting Help

1. Check the server console for errors
